		<h2 class="destination">2. Beijing China</h2>

			<p>A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on viewin the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/asia/china/beijing/" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

		<h2 class="destination">3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the city centercomplete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments.<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/asia/south-korea/seoul/" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>
